master branch status

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4fgaaeakffhf32vu/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stuartleeks/nether/branch/master)


## Prerequisites

### Development Machine Setup

#### Operating System

The goal of Nether is to be available on both Windows and OSX (Mac), hence any up to date version of those operating systems should be ok.

#### Visual Studio Code and/or full version of Visual Studio

All code should compile and work on both Windows and OSX hence we strive to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for as much as possible. We also  support [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) on Windows.

#### .NET Core

Nether is built on top of .NET Core. Install from https://dot.net/core

#### MongoDB
The out-of-the-box configuration for nether requires MongoDB to be installed on your machine, and started listening on the default port.

## Optional Prerequisites

### Unity

We support and build SDKs for [Unity](http://unity3d.com) but Nether as service is available from any operating system that would have access to Internet.
