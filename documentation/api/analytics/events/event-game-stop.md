# game-stop

Event to be sent at the end of a game session, signaling that the game/the app is about to end or has ended. Will be used to calculate things like: Session Length, etc.

## When?
The game/app is about to exit or go into a stale state

## Why?
Nether uses Game Stop Events to signal that a game session is over. If Nether doesn't receive a Game Stopp Event, it will use the last Game Heartbeat to conclude the length of the session, etc. Together with Game Heartbeat Event and the Game Stop Event these events make up the foundation in many reports generated by the analytics pipepline.
