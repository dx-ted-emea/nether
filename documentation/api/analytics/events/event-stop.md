# stop

Event to be sent at the end of a measured period.

## When?
Whenever a measured time period ends. Can only be used together with a related start event.

## Why?
Nether uses Stop Events to signal that a time period is over. Before a stop event is being sent any previously sent start events will be considered obsolete.
