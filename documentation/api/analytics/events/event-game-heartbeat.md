# game-heartbeat

Event to be sent at least once every minute, signaling that the game is still being played. Will be used to calculate things like: Concurrent Users, etc.

## When?
At least once every minute (by default)

## Why?
Nether uses Game Heartbeat Events to signal that a game session is still going on. If Nether doesn't receive a Game Stopp Event, it will use the last Game Heartbeat to conclude the length of the session, etc. Together with Game Heartbeat Event and the Game Stop Event these events make up the foundation in many reports generated by the analytics pipepline.
